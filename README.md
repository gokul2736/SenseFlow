**TLead:** Markandeyan Gokul  
**TMemb:** Kanamarlapudi Sai Charithanjali 

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional antivirus systems use signature-based detection, which fails against "Clean Attacks" (Business Email Compromise). SenseFlow uses **Semantic Analysis (BERT)** to detect psychological triggers like Urgency and Authority.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
* **AI Engine:** Google BERT (via Hugging Face Transformers)
* **Explainability:** LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Backend:** PyTorch & Python 3.9+

## 📂 Project Structure
* `data/`: Raw and processed datasets (Ignored by Git).
* `src/`: Production-grade source code.
* `notebooks/`: Experimental labs for model training.
* `docs/logs/`: Weekly trial & error logs for PBL review.
